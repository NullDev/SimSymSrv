SimSymSrv - Simple Symbol Server Downloader <br>
_I shouldn't be allowed to name things..._

## What is this?
This is a simple CLI tool to download official Microsoft Debugging Symbols from the Microsoft Symbol Server ([SymSrv](https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols))

- You provide a file (EXE / DLL / SYS)
- You provide a directory
- It downloads the symbols to that directory

Simple as that.

This is however still in its rough stages, and it's also my very first Zig project...
