SimSymSrv - Simple Symbol Server Downloader <br>
<sub><i>I shouldn't be allowed to name things...</i></sub>
</p>

---

## What is this?
This is a simple CLI tool to download official Microsoft Debugging Symbols <br>
from the Microsoft Symbol Server ([SymSrv](https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols))

- You provide a Microsoft Binary (EXE / DLL / SYS)
- You provide a directory
- It downloads the debugging symbols to that directory

Simple as that.

## Why? 
So you can reverse and debug official MS binaries. Yay...

## Note
This is however still in its rough stages, and it's also my very first Zig project...
